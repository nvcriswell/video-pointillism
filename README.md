# video-pointillism
Made in Processing. This sketch takes a video file and warps the video by incorporating pixelation, speed adjustment, pixel size, and rate of pixel generation. 

One needs to have Processing downloaded in order to run the sketch as Processing sketches can no longer be hosted locally.
