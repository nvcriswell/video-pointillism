# video-pointillism
Made in Processing. This sketch takes a video file and simulates pointillism using Object-Oriented Programming, framerate warping, and pixel size adjustment.

One needs to have Processing downloaded in order to run the sketch as Processing sketches can no longer be hosted locally.
